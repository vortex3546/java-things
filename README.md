# Instructions

To run the project, you can use either the Command Prompt (cmd) or Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

## Running via Command Prompt
If you're not sure how to run Java through the Command Prompt, you can find instructions [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16137713/how-do-i-run-a-java-program-from-the-command-line-on-windows).

## Running via Visual Studio Code
You can also use Visual Studio Code, but you need to download an extension for Java to debug, test, and run your program. You can download the extension from this link: [VS Code Java Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack).

## Installing Java
If you don't have Java installed, you can download the installer from the following link: [Java Installer](https://github.com/vortex3546/java-things/blob/a1eafec3866a5c62cf25c164ac108a96a11bdaed/JavaSetup8u421%20(1).exe).
